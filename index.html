        <p>Ensuring Efficient Practice Management</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dental billing plays a critical role in the financial health of dental practices across the USA. However, managing billing in-house often leads to challenges like claim denials, delayed reimbursements, and administrative burdens. To overcome these obstacles, many practices turn to professional dental billing services, which streamline operations and maximize revenue. In this blog, we explore the best dental billing services in the USA, including how they address common billing challenges and why Dental Revenue Group (DRG) stands out.</p>

        <h2>1. Understanding Dental Billing</h2>
        <p>Dental billing involves processing and submitting claims for dental procedures to insurance companies. Unlike medical billing, dental billing requires expertise in procedure codes like CDT (Current Dental Terminology) and often deals with separate insurance providers for dental coverage. Accuracy and compliance are crucial, as errors can lead to claim denials and financial losses.</p>

            <li><strong>Insurance Verification Issues:</strong> Verifying patient eligibility and benefits is time-consuming and error-prone.</li>
